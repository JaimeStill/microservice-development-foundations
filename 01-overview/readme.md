# Overview

The following workshop will focus on taking a very simple data model, and walking through each stage of the development platform. The intent is not for you to memorize all of the specific details that are shown or discussed, but to establish an initial acquaintance. This way a degree of familiarity exists when looking at a concept from a more complex perspective.

This workshop is split into three different segments:

* [**Project Setup**](./project-setup.md) - Focused on building out all of the infrastructure needed to follow along with building out a Node and an App.
* [**Node Development**](./node-development) - Focused on building a Node through the development of a data model, data context, service, and API controller.
* [**App Development**](./app-development) - Focused on building an Angular App.
